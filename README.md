    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables** for Stripe keys and Flask:

    - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your **Stripe** test keys and **Flask secret key**:

      ```bash
      STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
      STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
      FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_flask_secret_key
      ```

5. **Set up the SQLite database**:

    ```bash
    flask shell
    >>> from app import db
    >>> db.create_all()
    ```

6. **Insert product data** (optional):

    - Run the provided script to insert sample products into the database.

    ```bash
    python insert_products.py
    ```

7. **Run the Flask app**:

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

8. Visit the app at `http://localhost:5000/`.

## Usage
